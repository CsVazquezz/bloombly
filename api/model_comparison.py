Approach:
  1. ❌ Predicts SPECIES, not bloom occurrence
     - Trains on: "Which species is at this location?"
     - We want: "Will this species bloom here?"
     
  2. ❌ Only trains on positive examples (all blooms)
     - No concept of "no bloom" conditions
     - Can't distinguish favorable from unfavorable conditions
     
  3. ❌ Random location generation
     - Generates 200 random points in AOI
     - No relationship to actual bloom patterns
     
  4. ❌ Arbitrary confidence scores
     - Species probability × arbitrary environmental factors
     - Example: 0.67 × (1 + 0.02(temp-15)) × (1 + 0.005(precip-50))
     - No learned relationship!
     
  5. ❌ No temporal modeling
     - Doesn't learn seasonal dynamics
     - Just checks if day is within ±60 days of historical mean

Training Data:
  - 1,179 bloom observations (all labeled bloom=1)
  - 0 non-bloom observations
  - Model never sees negative examples!

Prediction Process:
  Step 1: Generate 200 random locations
  Step 2: Get environmental data for each
  Step 3: Scale features
  Step 4: Predict species (highest probability)
  Step 5: Use species probability as "bloom probability"
  Step 6: Multiply by arbitrary environmental factors
  Step 7: Filter by threshold

Output Example:
  {
    "bloom_probability": 0.42,  ← NOT from bloom prediction!
                                  ← This is species classification prob
                                  ← multiplied by made-up factors
    "prediction_confidence": 0.42,
    "is_prediction": true
  }

Why It's Trash:
  🗑️ Model doesn't predict blooms at all
  🗑️ "Probability" is species classification × random math
  🗑️ No learning of bloom dynamics
  🗑️ Output is glorified random sampling

print("""
Approach:
  1. ✅ Predicts BLOOM PROBABILITY directly
     - Binary classification: bloom vs no-bloom
     - Trained specifically on this task
     
  2. ✅ Trains on positive AND negative examples
     - 1,179 bloom events
     - ~3,000 no-bloom events (generated from off-season)
     - Learns what conditions lead to blooms vs not
     
  3. ✅ Intelligent location sampling
     - Focuses on historical bloom areas ± 20% exploration
     - Gaussian sampling around known bloom centers
     - Spatially coherent predictions
     
  4. ✅ ML-predicted confidence scores
     - Calibrated probabilities from Gradient Boosting
     - Based on learned patterns from training data
     - Reflects actual bloom likelihood
     
  5. ✅ Rich temporal modeling
     - Cyclical encoding (sin/cos for seasons)
     - Days from species-specific bloom windows
     - 30-day environmental trends and rolling averages

Training Data:
  - 1,179 positive examples (bloom events)
  - ~3,000 negative examples (no-bloom conditions)
  - Generated using:
    * Same locations ±60-90 days (temporal offsets)
    * Random locations in species range during off-season
  - Model learns bloom vs no-bloom patterns!

Features (21 total):
  Spatial (2):
    - lat, lon
    
  Temporal (6):
    - day_of_year, month, week_of_year
    - day_sin, day_cos (cyclical encoding)
    - days_from_species_mean
    
  Environmental - Temperature (4):
    - temp_mean (30-day average)
    - temp_max, temp_min
    - temp_range (variability indicator)
    
  Environmental - Precipitation (2):
    - precip_total (30-day sum)
    - precip_mean (30-day average)
    
  Environmental - Vegetation (3):
    - ndvi_mean (30-day average greenness)
    - ndvi_max (peak greenness)
    - ndvi_trend (slope of vegetation change)
    
  Environmental - Other (1):
    - elevation
    
  Derived Features (3):
    - growing_degree_days (accumulated heat)
    - moisture_index (precip/temp ratio)
    - vegetation_health (ndvi × trend)

Prediction Process:
  Step 1: Sample locations near historical blooms (Gaussian)
  Step 2: For each location, build 21-feature vector
  Step 3: Get 30-day environmental aggregations from EE
  Step 4: Calculate temporal and derived features
  Step 5: Scale features with trained StandardScaler
  Step 6: Predict bloom probability with Gradient Boosting
  Step 7: Filter by confidence threshold (default 0.3)
  Step 8: Sort by probability, return top predictions

Validation:
  - Time-Series Cross-Validation (5-fold)
  - ROC-AUC: Measures probability calibration
  - Precision: Of predicted blooms, how many are real?
  - Recall: Of actual blooms, how many did we predict?
  - F1-Score: Harmonic mean of precision & recall

Output Example:
  {
    "bloom_probability": 0.847,  ← ACTUAL ML prediction!
                                  ← Calibrated probability from
                                  ← Gradient Boosting trained on
                                  ← bloom vs no-bloom classification
    "model_version": "v2_bloom_dynamics",
    "environmental_factors": {
      "temperature": 22.3,
      "precipitation": 85.2,
      "ndvi": 0.682,
      "ndvi_trend": 0.0032  ← Vegetation increasing
    }
  }

Why It's Actually Good:
  ✅ Predicts bloom probability directly
  ✅ Learns from bloom AND no-bloom examples
  ✅ Captures temporal patterns (seasonality, trends)
  ✅ Incorporates environmental dynamics (30-day windows)
  ✅ Proper validation (time-series aware)
  ✅ Calibrated confidence scores
  ✅ Spatially intelligent predictions

v1 Model Assessment: 🗑️ TRASH
  - Doesn't predict blooms (predicts species instead)
  - No negative examples (can't learn bloom conditions)
  - Random sampling with arbitrary math
  - Not scientifically valid

v2 Model Assessment: ✅ SCIENTIFICALLY SOUND
  - Predicts bloom probability directly
  - Learns from bloom AND no-bloom examples
  - Captures temporal and environmental dynamics
  - Proper validation and calibration
  - Still needs more data, but foundation is solid

Verdict: v2 is a FUNDAMENTAL IMPROVEMENT over v1.
         Not perfect (limited data), but actually learns bloom dynamics!
